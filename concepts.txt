/**********************************************   NPM  VERSIONING     **********************************************/

--> when we install any package using npm install --save express then in package.json in dependencies object in front
    of express version a carrot sign appears(^) say  "express" : "^4.16.3" which means that it is going to automatically
    update its version for you as new package version comes out.
    ~ means 4.16.x ie it will update the most minor version when npm install is executed.

    It will keep 4.xx.x and update the rest when we run npm install.
    When no sign in front then it will not update the version automatically.

--> ~/.npmrc file configuration

progress=false
save=true
save-exact=true

This configuration in npmrc will enable two things . 
npm install <packageName> will directly get attached in dependencies property of package.json
and ~ & ^ will not get attached before the package version 

--> DEBUG Package is used for debugging. To run the app --> set DEBUG = * & node app.js
--> Morgan is used to see the web traffic. set app.use(morgan('combined/tiny')).
